# Getting_and-Cleaning-Data
Coursera Course
The objective of the course is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a dataset. 
The steps to work the code are as follows:
1. Download run_analysis.r and run_analysis.rmd files in a common directory
2. Open a R session and set the working directory using setwd() as the directory in which the files in step 1 were saved
3. Run the run_analysis.r file 
4. There will be a run_analysis.html file generated which describes the step by step working of the code in rmd file 
5. Also there will be a tidy dataset Tidy.txt/ Tidy.csv saved in the working directory which can be observed for sanity check.

Thanks
